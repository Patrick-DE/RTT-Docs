# HTA
An HTA is a proprietary Windows program whose source code consists of HTML and one or more scripting languages supported by Internet Explorer (VBScript and JScript).
An HTA executes without the constraints of the browser's security model, so it executes as a "fully trusted" application.
An HTA is executed using `mshta.exe`, which is typically installed along with IE. In fact, `mshta` is dependent on IE, so if it has been uninstalled, HTAs will be unable to execute.
